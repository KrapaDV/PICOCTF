Checking out the source page there was hardly any info. Trying a random user name and password takes us to another page which says "Log In Failed". On inspecting the page we come across secure.js file. The file hints towards the username being 'admin' and password being 'strongPassword098765'. Typing this info on the main log in page gets us our flag.
