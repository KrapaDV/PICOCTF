  The question said to divide the text into group of 3 letters. The 1st group turned out to be 'heT' second one turned out to be 'fl '. Looking that 'heT' we can conver it to 'The' by moving the letter in 3rd position to the 1st and then shifting 1st and 2nd to second and third position respectively. Doing this for all the group of letters we get 'The flag is picoCTF{7R4N5P051N6_15_3XP3N51V3_56E6924A}'
