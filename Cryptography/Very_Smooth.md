  In the 2 file we download, one has a python code and other has the value to n and c in hexadecimal format. 1st we need to convert n and c from hex to decimal. Now in the python file we get value of e in hexadecimal format, we need to convert it to decimal. We now have the value of n c and e. Using RSA we get our flag.
