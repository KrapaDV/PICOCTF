## Cookies
In the search tab putting cyber cookies as the values didn't work. When tried with gingerbread the site didn't completely reject the value rather quoted "I love gingerbread cookies!". A similar thing happened when we enter snickerdoodle it quotes "I love snickerdoodle cookies!". When we inspect the page, under the Application tab, there is a cookies file. When on deep inspection it is to be noted that every time wwe enter a cookie name the value of 'name' changes. Keeping this in mind, when we manually change the value in cookies tab we get different values. For value = 18 we get our flag.
