## WEB EXPLOITATION

## Scavenger Hunt
  Going to the source page of the web page, we get the 1st part of our flag. We find a 'mycss.css' file which conatins the second part of the flag. When we open 'myjs.js' file, it provides us with a clue ' How can I keep Google from indexing my website?' this can be done by adding /robots.txt to the website link. We then get the 3rd part of our flag. We also get another clue to find the next part, the clue being 'I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?'. For this we need to add /.htaccess to the end of the websit link. We then get the 4th part of the flag. Along with the flag we also get a clue to find the next part ' I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.' . For this we need to add /.DS_Store to the end of the websit link. We then get the 5th part of the flag.
